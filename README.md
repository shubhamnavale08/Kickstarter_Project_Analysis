# Kickstarter_Project_Analysis

### ✅️Introduction
In this notebook I will share my analysis of a dataset of roughly 366,000 Kickstarter projects. Kickstarter is one of the most popular platforms for promoting and bringing to life creative projects, from Music, Art, Film and Games, you name it. Each project does this by seeking funding from the Kickstarter crowd to support their idea and hopefully see it succeed. However, many projects fail and I will walk you through my analysis through data exploration with SQL to reveal insights into Kickstarter projects and their success and failure. I will then visualise the data in Power BI to present my findings and draw recommendations to my summary question, which you will find further down.


























In Conclusion 
The average success rate of a project at Kickstarter is 36% and the median goal is 5K Dollars (the median was calculated only for projects financed in dollars)
An entrepreneur who wants to fund projects in the category of music or other art categories should consider starting a Kickstarter project because the average rate in these categories are above 55%. However, technology projects are less successful on this platform.
Between the years 2014 and 2015 there was growth in the number of projects. The growth happened in most of the categories and especially in the technology category.
This analysis can be further elaborated upon by examining whether the project goal amount or country of origin affect the success of the project.
