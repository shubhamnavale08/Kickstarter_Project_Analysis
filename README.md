# Kickstarter_Project_Analysis

### ✅️Introduction
In this notebook I will share my analysis of a dataset of roughly 366,000 Kickstarter projects. Kickstarter is one of the most popular platforms for promoting and bringing to life creative projects, from Music, Art, Film and Games, you name it. Each project does this by seeking funding from the Kickstarter crowd to support their idea and hopefully see it succeed. However, many projects fail and I will walk you through my analysis through data exploration with SQL to reveal insights into Kickstarter projects and their success and failure. I will then visualise the data in Power BI to present my findings and draw recommendations to my summary question, which you will find further down.
